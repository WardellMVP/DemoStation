Create a modern React web application called "ScriptHub" focused primarily on these two key areas:

1. User Interface:
   - Clean, modern design with a dark theme option for cybersecurity aesthetics
   - Responsive layout that works well on both laptops and tablets
   - Intuitive navigation with clear categorization of available scripts
   - Animated transitions between pages and components for a polished feel
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling with a color scheme that incorporates dark blue, gray, and white colors

2. Core Functionality:
   - Homepage with a clean, grid-based list of available scripts
   - Script detail page that allows users to:
      * Download the script directly from GitLab (using my API key)
      * Run the script directly from the web app
      * Edit the YAML configuration file with a user-friendly interface
      * View the README file for each script
   - Backend integration that:
      * Connects to GitLab API to fetch scripts, READMEs, and configuration files
      * Allows running Python scripts directly from the web application
      * Handles configuration file modification and application

Technical Requirements:
- Use React with TypeScript for frontend development
- Implement a clean component structure that makes it easy to add new features later
- Include a YAML editor component with syntax highlighting
- Create a script execution engine that can run Python scripts with the modified configurations
- Set up GitLab API integration to fetch and display repository content
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Create a simple backend service (Node.js) that can:
  * Execute Python scripts securely
  * Pass configuration parameters to the scripts
  * Return script output to the frontend
  * Handle GitLab API authentication (storing my API key securely)

The application should be designed so I can simply plug in my project folder containing the Python scripts and YAML files, configure the GitLab API connection, and have everything work seamlessly.

Focus on making the script running and configuration editing experience intuitive - the current workflow involves manually editing YAML files and running Python scripts from the command line.
